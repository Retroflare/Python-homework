# Question 1:
#   Write a function to print “hello_USERNAME!” USERNAME is the input of the function. The first line of the code has been defined as below.
def hello_name(user_name):
print("hello_" + user_name  )

# Question 2:
# Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing
def first_odds():
        for number in range(1 , 100):
        print(number)

  # Question 3:
  # Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. The first line of the code has been defined as below.
    def max_num_in_list(a_list):  
    max_num = float int# Initialize max_num to negative infinity
    for num in a_list:
        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
return max_num

#  Question 4:
# Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. The return should be boolean Type (true/false).
def is_leap_year(a_year):
    if year 4 == 0:
        if year % 100 == 0:
            if year % 400 == 0:
                return True
            else:
                return False
       
    
    #Question 5:
    #Write a function to check to see if all numbers in list are consecutive numbers. For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. The return should be boolean Type.
    def is_consecutive(a_list):
        def are_numbers_consecutive(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return True

    for in_range(len(sorted_numbers)):
        if sorted_numbers[i] != start + i:
            return False

    return True
